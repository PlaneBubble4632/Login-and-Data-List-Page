Every time you stop the program delete the data.db.
If it didn't launch the first time try deleting the data.db file and rerunning again.
That's all ty :>

Also i realized that there's a glitch where if i auto-fill the input background color will change to default so i fixed it with a code(under .back-link:hover section) i found online.
